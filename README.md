## Details

When the user opens the website, they will be on the store's landing page. This page contains a nav-bar (1), which displays a list of the menus available on the website. The website also has a footer (2), which is located at the bottom of the page. When the user clicks the "go to shop" button, they will be taken to the homepage.
