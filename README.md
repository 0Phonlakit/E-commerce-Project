## Details

When the user opens the website, they will be on the store's landing page. This page contains a nav-bar (1), which displays a list of the menus available on the website. The website also has a footer (2), which is located at the bottom of the page. When the user clicks the "go to shop" button, they will be taken to the homepage.

When the user arrives at the homepage, they will see a list of the most popular products. Each product will have a picture, name, price, and a button to add it to the cart. The user can tell that they are on the popular products page by looking at the URL (4). If the user is on any other page, they can click the "Home" button (5) to return to the popular products page.
